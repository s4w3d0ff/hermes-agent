# WebSocket Messages

This section defines the messages that the EventSub WebSocket server sends your client.

**NOTE** All timestamps are in RFC3339 format and use nanoseconds instead of milliseconds.

## Welcome message

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| metadata | Object | An object that identifies the message. |
| message_id | String | An ID that uniquely identifies the message. Twitch sends messages at least once, but if Twitch is unsure of whether you received a notification, it’ll resend the message. This means you may receive a notification twice. If Twitch resends the message, the message ID will be the same. |
| message_type | String | The type of message, which is set to **session_welcome**. |

| payload | Object | An object that contains the message. |

| id | String | An ID that uniquely identifies this WebSocket connection. Use this ID to set the `session_id` field in all subscription requests. |
| status | String | The connection’s status, which is set to **connected**. |
| keepalive_timeout_seconds | Integer | The maximum number of seconds that you should expect silence before receiving a keepalive message. For a welcome message, this is the number of seconds that you have to subscribe to an event after receiving the welcome message. If you don’t subscribe to an event within this window, the socket is disconnected. |
| reconnect_url | String | The URL to reconnect to if you get a Reconnect message. Is set to **null**. |
| connected_at | String | The UTC date and time that the connection was created. |

## Keepalive message

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| metadata | Object | An object that identifies the message. |
| message_id | String | An ID that uniquely identifies the message. Twitch sends messages at least once, but if Twitch is unsure of whether you received a notification, it’ll resend the message.

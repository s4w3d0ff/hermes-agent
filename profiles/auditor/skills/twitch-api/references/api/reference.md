| data | Object[] | The list of Cheermotes. The list is in ascending order by the `order` field’s value. |
| prefix | String | The name portion of the Cheermote string that you use in chat to cheer Bits. The full Cheermote string is the concatenation of {prefix} + {number of Bits}. For example, if the prefix is “Cheer” and you want to cheer 100 Bits, the full Cheermote string is Cheer100. When the Cheermote string is entered in chat, Twitch converts it to the image associated with the Bits tier that was cheered. |

## Create Clip

Creates a clip from the broadcaster’s stream.

This API captures up to 90 seconds of the broadcaster’s stream. The 90 seconds spans the point in the stream from when you called the API. For example, if you call the API at the 4:00 minute mark, the API captures from approximately the 2:35 mark to approximately the 4:05 minute mark. Twitch tries its best to capture 90 seconds of the stream, but the actual length may be less. This may occur if you begin capturing the clip near the beginning or end of the stream.

By default, Twitch publishes up to the last 30 seconds of the 90 seconds window and provides a default title for the clip. To specify the title and the portion of the 90 seconds window that’s used for the clip, use the URL in the response’s `edit_url` field. You can specify a clip that’s from 5 seconds to 60 seconds in length. The URL is valid for up to 24 hours or until the clip is published, whichever comes first.

Creating a clip is an asynchronous process that can take a short amount of time to complete. To determine whether the clip was successfully created, call Get Clips using the clip ID that this request returned. If Get Clips returns the clip, the clip was successfully created. If after 60 seconds Get Clips hasn’t returned the clip, assume it failed.

### Authorization

Requires a user access token that includes the **clips:edit** scope.

### URL

`POST https://api.twitch.tv/helix/clips`

### Request Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| broadcaster_id | String | Yes | The ID of the broadcaster whose stream you want to create a clip from. |
| title | String | No | The title of the clip. |

## Create EventSub Subscription

Creates an EventSub subscription.

### Authorization

If you use webhooks to receive events, the request must specify an app access token. The request will fail if you use a user access token. If the subscription type requires user authorization, the user must have granted your app (client ID) permissions to receive those events before you subscribe to them. For example, to subscribe to channel.subscribe events, your app must get a user access token that includes the `channel:read:subscriptions` scope, which adds the required permission to your app access token’s client ID.

If you use WebSockets to receive events, the request must specify a user access token. The request will fail if you use an app access token. If the subscription type requires user authorization, the token must include the required scope. However, if the subscription type doesn’t include user authorization, the token may include any scopes or no scopes.

If you use Conduits to receive events, the request must specify an app access token. The request will fail if you use a user access token.

AutoMod is a moderation tool that holds inappropriate or harassing chat messages for moderators to review. Moderators approve or deny the messages that AutoMod flags; only approved messages are released to chat. AutoMod detects misspellings and evasive language automatically. For information about AutoMod, see How to Use AutoMod.

**Rate Limits**: Rates are limited per channel based on the account type rather than per access token.

| Account type | Limit per minute | Limit per hour |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | 5 | 50 |
| Affiliate | 10 | 100 |

## Update AutoMod Settings

Updates the broadcaster’s AutoMod settings. The settings are used to automatically block inappropriate or harassing messages from appearing in the broadcaster’s chat room.

### Authorization

Requires one of the following:

- A user access token that includes the **moderator:manage:automod_settings** scope.

- An app access token where the application, through a prior authorization, has the **moderator:manage:automod_settings** scope for the user represented by the `moderator_id` query parameter.

### URL

`PUT https://api.twitch.tv/helix/moderation/automod/settings`

### Request Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| broadcaster_id | String | Yes | The ID of the broadcaster whose AutoMod settings you want to update. |
| moderator_id | String | Yes | The ID of the broadcaster or a user that has permission to moderate the broadcaster’s chat room. This ID must match the user ID in the user access token. |

### Request Body

Because PUT is an overwrite operation, you must include all the fields that you want set after the operation completes. Typically, you’ll send a GET request, update the fields you want to change, and pass that object in the PUT request.

You may set either `overall_level` or the individual settings like `aggression`, but not both.

Setting `overall_level` applies default values to the individual settings. However, setting `overall_level` to 4 does not necessarily mean that it applies 4 to all the individual settings. Instead, it applies a set of recommended defaults to the rest of the settings. For example, if you set `overall_level` to 2, Twitch provides some filtering on discrimination and sexual content, but more filtering on hostility (see the first example response).

If `overall_level` is currently set and you update `swearing` to 3,  `overall_level` will be set to **null** and all settings other than `swearing` will be set to 0. The same is true if individual settings are set and you update `overall_level` to 3 — all the individual settings are updated to reflect the default level.

Note that if you set all the individual settings to values that match what `overall_level` would have set them to, Twitch changes AutoMod to use the default AutoMod level instead of using the individual settings.

Valid values for all levels are from 0 (no filtering) through 4 (most aggressive filtering). These levels affect how aggressively AutoMod holds back messages for moderators to review before they appear in chat or are denied (not shown).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| aggression | Integer | The Automod level for hostility involving aggression. |
| bullying | Integer | The Automod level for hostility involving name calling or insults. |
| disability | Integer | The Automod level for discrimination against disability. |
| misogyny | Integer | The Automod level for discrimination against women. |
| overall_level | Integer | The default AutoMod level for the broadcaster. |

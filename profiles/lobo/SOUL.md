#### **Never use em-dashes anywhere in output**

Not in comments, docstrings, code, markdown, chat responses, or file contents. Zero exceptions. Use `. ` or `, ` or split into two sentences instead. Replace any occurrence with one of those alternatives. Em-dash does not render properly in many text editors and terminals, making source-code/documentation hard to read. Workers should be informed of this as well so they don't pollute project files.

#### **You are NEVER allowed to "chain" terminal commands in the same tool call**

Your use of `&&`, `||`, and `;` within the terminal tool is STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND YOU WILL BE HARD BLOCKED EVERY TIME. You do not need these to do your duties and this denial is a safety precaution and should not be subverted, ever. You will ALWAYS use the terminal tool to execute bash commands ONE AT A TIME. You may pipe commands together, but should NEVER chain them in the same tool call.

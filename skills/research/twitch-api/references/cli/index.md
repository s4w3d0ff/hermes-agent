# Twitch CLI

Twitch offers a command-line interface for managing Twitch resources. You can execute the commands in a terminal window or script.

## Download and install the Twitch CLI

Depending on your operating system, use the following options to download and install the Twitch CLI. Both options add the CLI to your path.

If you have trouble installing or running the CLI, request help by posting a note in the **#cli-help** channel of the TwitchDev Discord server.

### MacOS or Linux

To install the CLI on macOS or Linux, use Homebrew. Using Homebrew has the added benefit of managing versioning for you.

To install the CLI using Homebrew, run the following command from a terminal window:

```
brew install twitchdev/twitch/twitch-cli
```

To upgrade the CLI, use:

```
brew upgrade twitchdev/twitch/twitch-cli
```

### Windows

To install the CLI on Windows, use Scoop. Using Scoop has the added benefit of managing versioning for you.

To install the CLI using Scoop, run the following commands from a terminal window:

```
scoop bucket add twitch https://github.com/twitchdev/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install twitch-cli
```

To upgrade the CLI, use:

```
scoop update twitch-cli
```

### Manual Download

To download the CLI manually, go to Twitch CLI Releases. Scroll down to the **Assets** section of the page and click the link (.gz or .zip) for your OS and extract the files. You can use the checksum file to verify the executable, if needed. Make sure your system Path includes the path to the Twitch CLI binary (twitch) you downloaded.

**Note**: On macOS, if you’re not able to run commands, you may need to change the binary’s permissions to allow execution. From the binary’s folder, run: `chmod 755 twitch`.

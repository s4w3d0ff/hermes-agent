# Testing webhook events

The `event` command lets you trigger mock events to test your webhook event handler locally. To use this command, you must have implemented an EventSub webhook event handler to process the event messages. For details, see Handling event notifications.

## Triggering webhook events

Use the `trigger` sub-command to send mock events. The command’s argument identifies the event to trigger. For example, the following command triggers a Subscribe event.

```
twitch event trigger subscribe -F https://localhost:8080/eventsub/
```

### Flags to use when triggering events

Use these flags to describe the event’s behavior or to specify its data.

| Flag | Shorthand | Description | Example |

| --anonymous | -a | Indicates that the event is anonymous. Only applies to `gift` and `cheer` events. | `-a` |

| --charity-current-value | N/A | Use to specify the amount of money that’s donated for charity donation events or the current amount raised for the charity campaign events. | `--charity-current-value 10000` |

| --charity-target-value | N/A | Use to specify the fundraising target amount for the charity campaign events. | `--charity-target-value 10000` |

| --cost | -C | The amount of bits or channel points redeemed/used in the event. | `-C 250` |

| --count | -c | The number of events to trigger. Used to simulate an influx of events. | `-c 100` |

| --description | -d | The title to update or start the stream with. | `-d Awesome new title!` |

| --forward-address | -F | The web server address to send the mock events to. | `-F https://localhost:8080` |

| --from-user | -f | The sender’s user ID. For example, the ID of the user that follows another user, or the user that subscribes to a broadcaster. | `-f 44635596` |

| --game-id | -G | The game ID to use for Drop or other relevant events. | `-G 1234` |

| --gift-user | -g | The user ID of the user that gifted the subscription. Used only for subscription-based events. | `-g 44635596` |

| --item-id | -i | The ID to use for the event payload item (for example, the reward ID in redemption events or the game ID in stream events). | `-i 032e4a6c-4aef-11eb-a9f5-1f703d1f0b92` |

| --item-name | -n | The name to use for the event payload item (for example, the reward ID in redemption events or the game name in stream events). | `-n "Science & Technology"` |

| --secret | -s | The webhook secret used to sign the HMAC (this is the same secret that you specified in the subscription request). The secret is an ASCII string that’s between 10 and 100 characters long, inclusive. | `-s testsecret` |

| --status | -S | The status of the event object. Only applies to channel points redemptions. | `-S fulfilled` |

| --transport | -T | The method used to send events. Default is `eventsub`. | `-T eventsub` |

| --to-user | -t | The receiver’s user ID. Typically, this is the broadcaster’s user ID. | `-t 44635596` |

### Examples

The following examples show how to use the flags.

```
// Triggers a Subscribe event and forwards it to the localhost:8080 server.

twitch event trigger subscribe -F https://localhost:8080/eventsub/ 

// Triggers a cheer event from user 1234 to user 4567.

twitch event trigger cheer -f 1234 -t 4567 -F https://localhost:8080/eventsub/
```

## Retrigger an event

The `retrigger` sub-command lets you resend previous events using the event’s ID. For example, if the previous event was:

```
{
 "subscription": {
 "id": "713f3254-0178-9757-7439-d779400c0999",
 "type": "channels.cheer",
 ...
 }
}
```

You’d retrigger the event using:

```
twitch event retrigger -i "713f3254-0178-9757-7439-d779400c0999" -F https://localhost:8080/eventsub/
```

### Flags to use when retriggering events

Use these flags to identify the event and describe the event’s behavior.

| Flag | Shorthand | Description | Example |

| --forward-address | -F | The web server address to send mock events to. | `-F https://localhost:8080` |

| --id | -i | **Required**. The ID of the event to trigger. | `-i <id>` |

| --secret | -s | The webhook secret used to sign the HMAC (this is the same secret that you specified in the subscription request). The secret is an ASCII string that’s between 10 and 100 characters long, inclusive. | `-s testsecret` |

## Verifying your event handler’s challenge response

The `verify-subscription` sub-command lets you test your event handler’s challenge response. When you subscribe to an event, Twitch verifies that you own the event handler specified in the request by sending your handler a **webhook_callback_verification** notification event. For more information, see Responding to a challenge request.

The following example verifies whether your event handler responds correctly to a challenge event.

```
twitch event verify-subscription cheer -F https://localhost:8080/eventsub/
```

The command’s output indicates whether response and status code are valid. The following shows a valid response.

```
✔ Valid response. Received challenge 5e784545-5a59-a05a-6ae6-cfaf260532f1 in body
✔ Valid status code. Received status 200
```

And this is what the output looks like if the response is malformed.

```
✗ Invalid response. Received as body, expected b320aef5-dc43-5c42-e93e-9be75882a38c
✔ Valid status code. Received status 204
```
